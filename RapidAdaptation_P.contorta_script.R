#' newLeaf - Rapid Adaptation
#' This project analyses rapid adaptation in P. sylvestris, P. contorta, and T. heterophylla
#' This script focuses on P. contorta (Lodgepole pine)
#' Experimental setup:
#' 1. Origin population in North America (Skeena river)
#' 2. Seed germinated in UK & planted at Rowens & Benmore -> mature plantations
#' 3. Natural regeneration from mature plantations (naturalised)
#' Seeds taken from all three populations
#' 
#' Data collection:
#' first measurements taken on 19th & 20th February 2024
#'  everything left of date column = first measurements
#' second DBB measurements taken on 10th and 16th October 2025
#' second height measurements taken on  9th October 2025


#' Biological questions:
#' Do provenance/family and budburst/budset/height/root:shoot ratio correlate?
#' first need to know distribution of all variables and traits

# TO DO:
#' change date to days since... (especially for budburst and budset measurements)
#' check range & distribution of numerical values
#' remove NAs?
#' distinguish better between first and second measurements (e.g., DBB_1, DBB_2)
